# airline-tweet-sentiment
Classifying tweets about airlines into positive, negative and neutral. 

With an increasing social media presence for airlines, there is a demand for immediate responses to issues that may 
arise when travelling. In order to repond to tweets appropriately, it makes sense for us to target our resources to
 answering negative tweets first, and help sort out our customer issues. 

We want to be able to target our responses to messages. In order to do this appropriately, we might want 
to classify tweets to be able to provide a targeted response. In the future we might want to build a bot to reply, and 
for this we will need to be able to know about the sentiment of the tweets.

Having a classification system for incoming tweets will enable us to target our response and focus answering the 
negative tweets quicker.
