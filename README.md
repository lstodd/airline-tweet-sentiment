# airline-tweet-sentiment
Classifying tweets about airlines into positive, negative and neutral. 

We want to be able to target our responses to messages on social media. In order to do this appropriately, we might want 
to classify tweets to be able to provide a targeted response. In the future we might want to build a bot to reply, and 
for this we will need to be able to know about the sentiment of the tweets.

Having a classification system for incoming tweets will enable us to target our response and focus answering the 
negative tweets quicker.
